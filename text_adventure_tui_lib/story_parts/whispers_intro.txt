The morning fog clings to the cobblestones as you hurry through the narrow streets toward Master Elian's tower. Three days have passed since anyone last saw your mentor, and the city guard has all but given up the search. "Another eccentric scholar wandered off," they said with dismissive shrugs.

But you know better. Master Elian was no absent-minded academic. His recent obsession with the legendary Salted Crypt had consumed his every waking moment. Ancient texts, coastal maps, and cryptic symbols covered every surface of his study. If he's truly missing, it's because he found what he was looking for.

The tower door stands slightly ajar, just as you left it yesterday. Inside, dust motes dance in the pale morning light filtering through tall windows. The study awaits your investigation, holding secrets that may be the key to finding your missing mentor before it's too late.

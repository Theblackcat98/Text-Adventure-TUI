        You gather your tools and check your equipment one final time. The lockpicks
        gleam in the lamplight, and the smoke bomb feels reassuringly solid in your
        pocket. Everything is ready. The Clockwork Museum awaits, and with it, the
        greatest heist of your career.

      instruction: "The player is a master thief preparing for a heist. They should choose how to approach the museum - stealthily, boldly, or with careful planning. Present options that reflect different thieving approaches."

      text: |
        You spend time observing the museum from the shadows. The building is an
        impressive sight - all brass fittings and clockwork decorations that tick
        and whir in complex patterns. You note the guard rotations, the placement
        of the mechanical sentries, and most importantly, a service entrance that
        seems less heavily watched.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player has scouted the museum and learned about its defenses. They now know about a service entrance. Present them with options to either use this entrance or find another way in."

      text: |
        You slip through the service entrance like a shadow. The hallway beyond is
        dimly lit by brass gas lamps that cast dancing shadows on the walls. You
        can hear the distant ticking of countless clockwork mechanisms. So far,
        so good - no alarms, no guards. Your stealth skills have served you well.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player has successfully entered the museum stealthily. They are in a service hallway. They need to find their way to the main exhibition halls where the Temporal Gear is kept."

      text: |
        You stride confidently through the main entrance, nodding to the night
        guard as if you belong there. Your bold approach catches them off guard,
        and you're inside before they can react properly. However, you notice
        several mechanical sentries have taken note of your presence. This
        approach may have consequences later.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player entered boldly and is now in the main hall, but the mechanical sentries are suspicious. They need to find the Temporal Gear quickly before security responds."

        Following the museum's directory and your instincts, you make your way to
        the Chronos Exhibition Hall. The room is filled with incredible timepieces
        and temporal artifacts, but your eyes are drawn immediately to the center
        display case. There it is - the Temporal Gear, suspended in a field of
        soft blue light, slowly rotating as if time itself flows around it.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player has found the Temporal Gear in its display case. The case is clearly protected by advanced security. They need to figure out how to bypass the protection and steal the gear."

        You carefully examine the display case's locking mechanism. It's incredibly
        complex - a masterwork of clockwork engineering with multiple tumblers that
        shift in sequence. Using your finest lockpicks, you work with delicate
        precision. After several tense minutes, you hear the satisfying click of
        the final tumbler falling into place. The blue energy field flickers and dies.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player has successfully disabled the security on the display case. The Temporal Gear is now accessible. They should take it, but they need to be prepared for what happens next."

        You reach into the display case and carefully lift the Temporal Gear. The
        moment your fingers touch it, you feel a strange sensation - as if time
        itself is flowing through your hands. The gear is warm and seems to pulse
        with an inner rhythm. But your triumph is short-lived. Alarms begin to
        blare throughout the museum, and you hear the mechanical whirring of
        security sentries activating. Time to go!
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player has the Temporal Gear but alarms are sounding. They need to escape quickly. Present them with escape options - they might use their smoke bomb, try to sneak out, or make a bold dash for freedom."

        You pull out your smoke bomb and hurl it to the ground. Thick, choking
        smoke fills the exhibition hall, confusing the mechanical sentries and
        obscuring their sensors. Using the chaos to your advantage, you slip
        through the confusion and make your way to the exit. The smoke clears
        just as you disappear into the night, the Temporal Gear safely in your
        possession.

        Remembering your stealthy entry route, you retrace your steps through the
        service corridors. Your knowledge of the museum's layout serves you well
        as you avoid the main security response. The mechanical sentries are
        focused on the exhibition halls, leaving your escape route clear. You
        slip out the same way you came in, the perfect crime completed with
        perfect stealth.

        With no other options, you make a desperate dash for the exit. Mechanical
        sentries give chase, their brass limbs clanking as they pursue you through
        the halls. You barely make it out, suffering a few scrapes and bruises
        from their grasping claws, but the Temporal Gear is yours. It wasn't
        elegant, but sometimes a thief has to improvise.

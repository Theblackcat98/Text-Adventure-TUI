        The scent of old paper and dust hangs heavy in the air of your mentor's study.
        Master Elian has been missing for three days. The city guard considers him another
        eccentric old man who simply wandered off, but you know better. His obsession
        was the Salted Crypt, a place of myth that he swore was real. His desk is a
        clutter of maps, books, and unfinished notes. You came here to find a clue,
        any clue, as to where he might have gone.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player is in Master Elian's study. The goal is to find where he went. The most important objects in the room are the cluttered desk, a tall bookshelf filled with lore books, and a large map of the coastline pinned to the wall. Guide the player to investigate these things."

        You carefully sort through the mess on the desk. Beneath a stack of star charts,
        you find what you were looking for: his personal journal. The leather is cool
        to the touch, and a place is marked with a silken ribbon.

      text: |
        You open the journal to the marked page. Elian's handwriting is frantic.
        'I've found it! The maps were all wrong. It's not in the caves, it's *below*
        them. The entrance is only revealed when the tide is at its lowest. I must see
        it for myself. I will travel to the Saltstone Bluffs at once. The key... the
        key must be the one from the Tycendi ruin.'
    - type: modify_prompt

      text: |
        Remembering the journal's mention of a key, you run your hands along the spines
        of the old books on the shelf. One of them, 'A History of Tycendi Ruins', feels
        oddly light. You pull it out and discover it has been hollowed out. Nestled inside
        on a bed of velvet is a heavy, pitted bronze key. It hums with a faint energy.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player now has the key. They should travel to the Saltstone Bluffs to find Elian."

        You arrive at the Saltstone Bluffs. A fierce wind whips salt spray into your face.
        Below, powerful waves crash against the cliff face, churning the sea into a white
        foam. The tide is high, and there is no obvious entrance anywhere. It seems you'll
        have to wait.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player is at the Saltstone Bluffs. The key plot point is that the tide is too high. The player must wait. Let them explore the area, but remind them about the crashing waves. After a few turns, the 'tide_recedes' event will trigger."

      text: |
        You spend some time exploring the clifftop. As the sun begins to dip towards the
        horizon, you notice the waves below have grown calmer. The water has receded,
        exposing a wide, wet shelf of dark rock at the base of the bluff. And there,
        carved into the cliff face, is a seaweed-draped archway that was completely
        submerged before.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The tide is now low, revealing the entrance to the Salted Crypt. The player's next logical step is to descend the cliff and enter the archway."

        You carefully make your way down the slick rocks and step through the ancient archway.
        The air immediately becomes still and heavy with the smell of salt and decay.
        You are in a small antechamber, and before you stands a massive, circular stone
        door sealed with intricate bronze bands. A single, rune-etched keyhole sits in its center.
    - type: modify_prompt
      instruction: "The player is now in the crypt antechamber. They need to use the runic key to open the door and find Elian."

        You insert the Tycendi Runic Key into the lock. The runes on the key and the door
        flare with a bright blue light. With a deep groan of grinding stone, the massive
        door slides open.

        The chamber beyond is vast. Piles of gold and ancient artifacts lie in dusty heaps,
        but your attention is drawn to the center of the room. There, tied to a stone
        altar, is Master Elian! He is alive, though he looks weak. "By the archives!" he rasps, his eyes
        widening in disbelief. "You found me!"

        Without hesitation, you rush to Elian's side and quickly untie his bonds. He staggers
        to his feet, grateful but shaken. "Thank you," he whispers. "I was a fool to come
        here alone. The guardians of this place... they're not entirely gone." 
        
        Together, you help him gather some of the most valuable artifacts before making
        your escape. As you emerge from the crypt, the tide is already beginning to rise
        again. You've saved your mentor and uncovered treasures that will fund many future
        adventures. Well done!

        "What happened here?" you ask, staying alert as you approach. Elian's eyes dart
        around the chamber nervously. "The crypt's guardians... spectral beings that
        protect this place. They captured me when I tried to take too much. Be careful!"
        
        Heeding his warning, you carefully untie him while keeping watch. Together, you
        take only what you need and make a strategic retreat. Your caution pays off as
        you notice shadowy figures stirring in the deeper chambers. You've saved your
        mentor and learned valuable lessons about respecting ancient places. Wisdom
        and courage have served you well!
